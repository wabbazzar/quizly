# Testing Mastered Cards Toggle in Flashcards Mode

## Feature Summary

Added a toggle in the Flashcard settings to include or exclude mastered cards
from the session.

## Changes Made:

### 1. **FlashcardsSettings Component** (`src/components/modals/FlashcardsSettings.tsx`)

- Added `includeMastered` prop (defaults to true)
- Added "Mastered Cards" section with checkbox toggle
- Shows count of currently mastered cards
- Displays info message when mastered cards will be excluded
- Connected to deck store to get mastered cards count

### 2. **FlashcardsSettings Styles** (`src/components/modals/FlashcardsSettings.module.css`)

- Added `.masteredSettings` container styles
- Added `.checkboxOption` with hover and checked states
- Added `.checkboxContent`, `.checkboxLabel`, `.checkboxDescription` styles
- Added `.infoMessage` for the exclusion notification
- Semi-transparent styling consistent with the app design

### 3. **Flashcards Page** (`src/pages/Flashcards.tsx`)

- Added `includeMastered` state (defaults to true)
- Updated `createCardOrder` function to accept `excludeMastered` parameter
- Filters out mastered cards when `excludeMastered` is true
- For new sessions: automatically excludes mastered cards if any exist
- Reorders cards when the include/exclude setting changes
- Persists the setting in session storage

### 4. **FlashcardSessionStore** (`src/store/flashcardSessionStore.ts`)

- Added `includeMastered` field to `FlashcardSession` interface
- Defaults to true for backward compatibility
- Persists the setting across sessions

### 5. **Integration with Deck Store**

- Uses `getMasteredCardsForDeck` to get mastered card indices
- Filters card order array to exclude mastered cards when needed
- Works with all progression modes (shuffle, sequential, level)

## Testing Instructions:

### Basic Functionality:

1. Navigate to any deck and mark some cards as mastered (from deck view)
2. Start Flashcards mode
3. Open settings (gear icon)
4. Look for "Mastered Cards" section showing count of mastered cards
5. Toggle "Include mastered cards" checkbox:
   - **Checked (default)**: All cards included in session
   - **Unchecked**: Mastered cards excluded, info message appears

### Behavior Testing:

1. **With mastered cards excluded**:
   - Verify card count decreases
   - Verify mastered cards don't appear in rotation
   - Verify progress bar reflects reduced total

2. **Session persistence**:
   - Change include/exclude setting
   - Exit and re-enter flashcards mode
   - Setting should be remembered

3. **Progression modes**:
   - Test with each progression mode (shuffle, sequential, level)
   - Mastered cards should be filtered in all modes

4. **New sessions**:
   - Start a fresh session with mastered cards
   - Should automatically exclude them if any exist
   - Shows appropriate card count

### Edge Cases:

- **No mastered cards**: Toggle should still work, shows "No cards are currently
  mastered"
- **All cards mastered**: Should handle gracefully (though may need additional
  handling)
- **Missed cards round**: Mastered cards setting applies to new rounds only

## User Experience:

- Clear visual feedback on how many cards are mastered
- Info message when cards will be excluded
- Setting persists across sessions for convenience
- Automatic exclusion of mastered cards for new sessions improves learning
  efficiency
- Works seamlessly with progression modes and other settings
