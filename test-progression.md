# Testing Flashcard Progression Modes

## Test Summary

Successfully added sequential/shuffle/level-based progression options to the
Flashcard settings, similar to the Learn mode settings.

## Changes Made:

### 1. **FlashcardsSettings Component** (`src/components/modals/FlashcardsSettings.tsx`)

- Added `progressionMode` prop with type `'sequential' | 'shuffle' | 'level'`
- Added progression mode selection UI with radio buttons
- Updated save handler to include progression mode

### 2. **FlashcardsSettings Styles** (`src/components/modals/FlashcardsSettings.module.css`)

- Added styles for progression options radio buttons
- Semi-transparent backgrounds for selected state
- Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

### 3. **Flashcards Page** (`src/pages/Flashcards.tsx`)

- Added `progressionMode` state with default value 'shuffle'
- Created `createCardOrder` function to handle different ordering modes:
  - **Sequential**: Cards in original deck order
  - **Shuffle**: Random order using Fisher-Yates shuffle
  - **Level**: Cards sorted by difficulty level
- Updated settings handler to reorder cards when mode changes
- Applied progression mode to both new rounds and missed cards rounds

### 4. **FlashcardSessionStore** (`src/store/flashcardSessionStore.ts`)

- Added `progressionMode` to `FlashcardSession` interface
- Persists progression mode preference across sessions
- Exports `FlashcardSession` type for use in components

### 5. **Completion Modal Fix** (`src/components/modals/FlashcardsCompletionModal.tsx`)

- Removed numeric icon indicators (1, 2, 3) from buttons
- Kept keyboard shortcuts functional
- Added title attributes to show keyboard hints on hover
- Fixed modal centering on desktop

## Testing Instructions:

1. Navigate to any deck and start Flashcards mode
2. Click the settings gear icon
3. You should see a new "Card Progression" section with three options:
   - **Shuffle** (default): Random order for better retention
   - **Sequential**: Cards in order as they appear in deck
   - **By Level**: Progress from easier to harder cards
4. Select different modes and verify:
   - Cards are reordered immediately when mode changes
   - The order persists across sessions
   - Missed cards rounds also respect the selected progression mode
5. Test keyboard shortcuts (1, 2, 3) in completion modal still work without
   icons

## Known Behavior:

- Changing progression mode resets to the first card
- Progression mode is saved per deck and persists across sessions
- When in "missed cards" round, changing progression mode won't reorder until
  the next round
