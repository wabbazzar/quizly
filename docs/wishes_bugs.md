i want to organize all the current decks under a "lesson" this lesson will be chinese, obviously. lessons have the feature of being able to open a dictionary - a searchable db of all the words in the
  lesson. I'm just not sure visualy how i want to organize this into quizly, especially considering we only have one lesson for now.
